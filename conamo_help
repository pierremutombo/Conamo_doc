HOW TO FLASH CONAMO ROOT OR CHILD BOARD == 



The OpenWSN CONAMO firmware should be in the conamo-openwsn repository under the branch “final_version”
And in this file
https://github.com/imec-idlab/conamo-openwsn/blob/final_version/bsp/boards/openmote-cc2538/uart.c
you see on lines 67-71 and 75-78
lines that should be commented/uncommented depending on the board
if you are using the openmotes (the purple ones), uncomment 67-71 (and comment the 75-78) and if you are using the red ones, uncomment 75-78 and comment 67-71
